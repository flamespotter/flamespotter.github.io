<p>"What did you do, when you walked out of the Twentieth Century?"</p>

<p>"I went out to become a <b>flame-spotter</b>. I made it my job to watch for
those bright flares in the growing night of savagery, which were the men of
ability, the men of the mind&mdash;to watch their course, their struggle and
their agony&emdash;and to pull them out, when I knew that they had seen
enough."</p>
